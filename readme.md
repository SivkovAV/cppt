# cpp-syntactic-sugar

Syntactic sugar for any popular c++ operations and functions

Goals:
* reduce code size
* make code easier to read/write
* make code more functional

The Syntax is close to the Python language.

Have unit-tests (Microsoft Visual Studio solution: c++ and QT-framework).
